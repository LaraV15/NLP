1  p a g e lost ruins of armak complete strategy guide beginner  average  experienced  expert if you are a beginner 0  2 games played this is mostly not a deckbuilding game unlike other deckbuilding games like dominion this game does not encourage deck improvement beyond the 2nd round the game only lasts 5 rounds so the cards you buy in rounds 1 and 2 are typically the only cards that will be played more than once you should therefore focus on buying the best cards see below at the beginning then exploration and research starting on round 23 get assistants early although it may seem like you have to spend many resources just to get something that gives you a single resource it is very worth it in most highlevel games players will have at least 1 if not 2 assistants by the end of the 1st round they will also upgrade them as soon as possible you will want to max your research points anyways so getting assistants early
will have at least 1 if not 2 assistants by the end of the 1st round they will also upgrade them as soon as possible you will want to max your research points anyways so getting assistants early gets you more resources do not focus on exiling although fear cards appear to be dead weight they can be just as useful as a coin or compass the boot travel symbol that fear provides allows you to go to the tent sites starting locations many things in the game also require discarding a card as a cost like the jewel starting location there are enough good things you can do with fear that it is ok to have around 1 in each round so you do not need to exile them right away specifically if exploring on round one do not explore onto an exile bonus the best cards and assistants are flexible your needs will change each round depending on what guardians you encounter where you are on the research track and what else is in your hand

you get the 2gold assistant  you send one of your archeologists to get 2 gold  you bought a coin artifact ex traders scales serpents gold instead you should by 23 cheap cards you will have a much stronger second round and you might have enough money to still compete for cards like dog some early artifacts can also contribute towards a strong deck ex star charts guiding skull plan to explore on round 2 if you have bought items during round one it will be unlikely that you will have 2 fears in your second hand it is therefore most efficient for you to spend some of your travel symbols going to a tier 1 or tier 2 location you should therefore go into round 2 with at least 1 compass to spare or have bought items that give enough compasses for you to explore send your glass and journal in different directions on bird side it is crucial that you do not
explore send your glass and journal in different directions on bird side it is crucial that you do not advance both of your tokens to the jewel space it then becomes very difficult for you to advance further since you need a lot of tablets and arrows and will be competing for them with other players even if you could get a very good assistant by advancing both of your tokens onto the jewel space it is usually a mistake have at least one of them ideally the glass advance to the compassarrow space so that you can have the option of advancing to the secondlevel jewel space get as many research track bonuses as possible the extra resources will help you research more which will in turn help you get more of the bonuses competition around these bonuses is fierce if one player gets all of the bonuses 810 they will typically have about 10 more points 3  p a g e than they would have otherwise
fierce if one player gets all of the bonuses 810 they will typically have about 10 more points 3  p a g e than they would have otherwise let some guardians get you this is especially true in the first round exploring will give you a huge influx of resources 6 if exploring a tier 1 location if the resources given will help you with research it is often worth it to spend them there rather than overcoming the guardian since you will get more resources back in the form of compasses and assistants you will take a fear but if you get a good assistant it is a good trade one example is the monkey guardian 4coins on the first round players usually have 4 coins available and use them to clear the guardian this is usually a mistake since that is the most important time to be buying cards it would be better to take the fear buy 2 cards than clear the guardian and get no items
this is usually a mistake since that is the most important time to be buying cards it would be better to take the fear buy 2 cards than clear the guardian and get no items save your 3rd and 4th idols spending the first two idols quickly is usually a good investment spending either of the last two idols is very costly both in points and in your flexibility do not spend your 4th idol until the last round if at all spending your 4th idol is only sometimes worth 4 points and it is very difficult to judge accurately unless it is the last round if you are already playing this way you should be scoring at least 70 each game sometimes in the 80s play some more games and then read the next section to eek out another 10 points if you are an experienced player 10  30 games played take fear locations and artifacts during rounds 4 and 5 the whole game is a race and
if you are an experienced player 10  30 games played take fear locations and artifacts during rounds 4 and 5 the whole game is a race and locations that give you a fear also give you an extra resource putting you slightly ahead of the other players the main downside to fear cards is that they can prevent you from drawing your good cards if you collect fear during rounds 4 and 5 however you likely will not draw any of them unless you have already drawn your whole deck the negative points at the end are trivial compared to the advantage of being slightly ahead of your opponents if you have means of making fear useful ex bootarrow assistant you can do this as early as round 2 4  p a g e prioritize buying selfexiling cards during round 3 these include  hot air balloon  coconut flask  rough map  journal  whip all of these give powerful 1time effects and are good cards to have at any point in the game
hot air balloon  coconut flask  rough map  journal  whip all of these give powerful 1time effects and are good cards to have at any point in the game they are especially good on rounds 4 and 5 however because you are aiming for more difficult exploration hot air balloon rough map higher research takes more resources journal there are more artifact choices available whip rough map and your cards are better coconut flask cards you buy in round 3 will likely only be played once anyways so normally powerful cards like lantern are often going to be a worse buy than selfexiling cards side note on bear trap it is a good card but only at the beginning of the game buying it on round 3 means you will want to use it on round 5 and if you are playing bird side you should be expecting to overcome a guardian for free via the research track play it in rounds 24 or it might end up redundant
expecting to overcome a guardian for free via the research track play it in rounds 24 or it might end up redundant stall if there are no good options sometimes all of the cards or assistants are mediocre usually your opponents are shopping around the same time as you so you can try to get them to buy first to reveal better options for you the most common stalling method is buying 1cost 5  p a g e equipment but if you have cards in hand research progress or archeologists left start with those additionally be aware of opponents cards that make purchases whip precision compass fishing rod and airdrop for example if someone bought whip on round 1 it is good to go into round 2 with extra compasses if you play before them in the next round you can get the visible good card first if you play after and there are not any good card available save the compasses for as long as possible they will usually buy something even if it is mediocre
visible good card first if you play after and there are not any good card available save the compasses for as long as possible they will usually buy something even if it is mediocre potentially revealing a good card that you are now ready to buy be careful with card draw drawing the right card is amazing but there are only a few situations where you can control which card you draw  large backpackobsidian earrings you just bought what you want to draw  crystal earringsmonkey idol youve placed on top of the deck the card you want to draw  you have so many carddrawing affects you know you will draw your entire deck  there is exactly 1 card in your deck and you remember what it is most of the time you wont know if the next card is going to be useful or not in these situations where you are considering spending resources to draw follow these rules  dont draw if there is another option that will get you what you need even if it is less
where you are considering spending resources to draw follow these rules  dont draw if there is another option that will get you what you need even if it is less efficient  dont draw if the top card might be bad to draw ex airplane with no archeologists  dont draw if most of the remaining cards in your deck net you only 1 resource  do draw if you need to discard but your current cards are essential ex guardian requires discard  do draw if most of your good cards are in the deck and you already have most of your bad cards explore tier2 locations when you are about to become the starting player sending an archeologist to a tier2 location is the most efficient way to use an archeologist with proper timing you can guarantee yourself a second trip and deny your opponents the opportunity this applies most often to player 3 exploring a tier2 on round 2 you will have to refrain from
timing you can guarantee yourself a second trip and deny your opponents the opportunity this applies most often to player 3 exploring a tier2 on round 2 you will have to refrain from exploring or buying artifacts the round before in order to save up enough compasses buying cards like hot air balloon rough map or automobilesteamboat should be a priority cheap items that give two travel symbols are also a great buy gold pan sturdy boots sometimes sacrifice exploring for artifacts bird side exploring gives more points and more resources than a single activation of an artifact the downsides to exploring are the unreliable resources and a fear if you do not overcome the guardian getting an idol mitigates the unreliability somewhat unless you have already spent 4 most artifacts are more reliable and increase the power of your deck to know which to spend your compasses on follow these guidelines
unreliability somewhat unless you have already spent 4 most artifacts are more reliable and increase the power of your deck to know which to spend your compasses on follow these guidelines  avoid 4cost 1point artifacts if you will only play it once unless it was free or it is the last round and you have already used both your archeologists  buy versatile artifacts at any point star charts stone key and tigerclaw hairpin  buy the artifact if it gives exactly what you need especially if there are no revealed locations that give those resources the opposite is true if it is at the end of the game and you can accurately anticipate the unrevealed location see below 6  p a g e  explore at the end if you are confident you can finish researching no matter what the site gives  buy artifacts that give 3 coins on rounds 12  explore a tier2 when you are about to become the starting player see above

many unhelpful artifacts basic these are all the cards that give either coins compasses or research resources they can be played in every circumstance and always give the same resources almost all of these cards are already perfectly efficient the one exception is gold pan  always try to use this as 2 travel symbols endofround bonus there are 3 cards that give you extra resources if you use them as your last action sundial stopwatch and chronometer think of what your needs next round will be if you need the extra resources from these cards play them at the end otherwise play them immediately also note that sundial gives its maximum value of 2 as either tabletjewel or as a travel symbol chronometer gives a value of 4 if used as travel symbols but you should try to use other cards first carddraw these are potentially the most powerful but only if you are able to play the drawn

revealedsite activation these either activate a revealed site remotely or moves one of your archeologists to the site and activates it maximize by planning to spend all of those resources this round in general use these cards later in a round once more information is revealed new guardianslocationscards use sturdy boots or passage shell as travel symbols when possible discount these give a discount for either buying cards moving up the research track or exploring maximize by getting the full discount ex buy a 4cost card with whip and by planning the round before how you will use the discount if you do not think you will be able to maximize the discount consider using the card as a travel symbol instead 7  p a g e fear these are the secondhardest resource to spend maximize by buying cardsassistants that require you to discard traveling to tent locations or overcoming guardians 13 of them require a boot symbol or discard
require you to discard traveling to tent locations or overcoming guardians 13 of them require a boot symbol or discard exile these are the hardest resource to spend you must have a fear to exile and if you are maximizing the fear itself you need to have already playeddiscarded it maximize by buying artifacts that give a fear or traveling to sites that give a fear plan to overcome a guardian with the research track bird side researching the last row with the journal lets you overcome a guardian on a spot you occupy for free that means that you need to plan typically the round before on where you want to send your journalwielding archeologist since there are usually only a few guardians or unexplored locations left if you cannot overcome a guardian in this way its better that you do not research the last spot it is only worth 2 points on its own spend all your resources each round to compete for research track bonuses you must

buy large backpack next hand has lots of money 8  p a g e  buy gold pan next hand has no boat travel symbols and you want to travel to a 2boat location also having a deck that has 10 total cards can be great in rounds 24 if you dont have any draw effects more common in early rounds having 10 total cards means you basically have 2 hands that you are switching between so you can know with 100 accuracy what your next hand will be you should also try to anticipate everyone elses next hands while you do not need to memorize everything keeping track of key cards can be quite helpful some examples include  surprise research cards see below  dogtigerclaw hairpin you can block the site they want  ostrichsea turtle you can predict where they will travel anticipate unrevealed locations near the end of the game most of the tier1 locations will
ostrichsea turtle you can predict where they will travel anticipate unrevealed locations near the end of the game most of the tier1 locations will have been revealed because there are only 10 tier1 locations in total once there are only 1 or 2 unexplored locations left you can more accurately guess what resources you might get by exploring them this is also important if one of the players is using guiding stone reveals a tier1 or guiding skull reveals a tier2 just like your own discard the revealed location goes onto the bottom of the deck for tier2 there are 6 total so you know that you will not see that location again until the other 5 have been revealed here are all the locations courtesy of cohensius httpsdocsgooglecomspreadsheetsd1h9k0_3cvyaooehpcmkxp for tier2 you just have to memorize them for tier1 notice there are about 3 of each  3 sites that give a jewel  4 sites that give an arrow
for tier2 you just have to memorize them for tier1 notice there are about 3 of each  3 sites that give a jewel  4 sites that give an arrow  4 sites that give a tablet  3 sites that give a coin  3 sites that give a compass  2 sites that draw so if theres a specific resource youre hoping for count how many of those locations you see if it is 1 or less you will probably get it if it is 23 you probably will not this only works once there are only 12 unexplored locations left starve your opponents in each round beyond the first you should be able to identify a resource an opponent will be short on sometimes there will only be one efficient way of getting the resource if you take it they will have to make inefficient and predictable moves that you can take advantage of playing like this will make everyone including you score lower the goal is
resource if you take it they will have to make inefficient and predictable moves that you can take advantage of playing like this will make everyone including you score lower the goal is to lose fewer points than your opponents the more players there are the less effective this is here are some examples of when you can starve an opponent  round 2 they took the coinarrow assistant and have no cards that give coins the only available card that would help them is gold pan you should buy the gold pan even if you do 9  p a g e not need the coins  round 2 bird side there are not any revealed locations that give tablets and your opponents need to pass the arrowtablettablet research space you should take the tablet tent location even if you do not need the tablets  round 5 they have already placed their archeologists and have spent all of their idols and are
if you do not need the tablets  round 5 they have already placed their archeologists and have spent all of their idols and are depending on a specific artifact to give them resources to continue research you should take that artifact especially if it is cheap ex sundial serpent idol surprise your opponents with research cards these are  idol of araanu research with a jewel discount  inscribed blade research with a 1arrow or 2tablet discount  journal research with the journal for free  carrier pidgeon 2 instant tablets if one of these cards is hidden in your hand try to use it to steal a researchtrack bonus from someone they will be playing be exactly one turn ahead see above and if your other resources indicate you cannot research on your next turn they will likely do something else leaving you an opening buy artifacts that refund their cost this is mostly for the last round so your deck does not
leaving you an opening buy artifacts that refund their cost this is mostly for the last round so your deck does not become too full of artifacts no artifacts give compasses directly so the main way to get their cost refunded is to refreshactivate assistants that give compasses the best case is with either the doublecompass assistant or the discount assistant you can also get the cost of an artifact refunded by drawing an item that gives compasses but you have to know for certain which card you will draw for example use money idolobsidian earring to get brushbow and arrows keep track of how many fearusing guardians you have seen the best way to use a fear card is on a guardian that requires a boot icon or a discard if you have have seen very few of these guardians and have a fear in hand explore first before using the fear in some other way ex lantern you are also likely to get an exile bonus from a guardian

hand probably the first thing you notice there are three possible states of your opening hand since of your three starting card types one of them will only appear once  1 fear the most flexible situation in the first round since you have all your useful cards in hand it is not always ideal however if you have the compasses in hand to explore 2 fear lets you grab a jewel first making it easier to get what you need from an explore action to be able to get your first assistant  1 coin this may reduce your buying potential or range of travel options which can occasionally be crucial but is usually manageable  1 compass arguably the most difficult opening hand as it will force most players to use the compass site first if they wish to explore this round cards scan the available cards to purchase and decide if any are worth competing for right off the bat some cards like dog and lantern are versatile enough to always be
cards scan the available cards to purchase and decide if any are worth competing for right off the bat some cards like dog and lantern are versatile enough to always be useful but depending on your objectives explore a lot research a lot continually improve your deck there are plenty of cards including 1cost cards that you might very much want depending on what you see it might prompt you to move to the coins camp first to afford aeroplane for instance or perhaps to buy a card before moving anyone at all to be clear while i will discuss the various objectives you might want to focus on in a moment every player should aim to buy some cards first round even if it is not their first priority and in general two cheap cards beat a single expensive one early card investment is essential for success throughout the game however when assessing the initial cards always ask why would i want this card what do i want to accomplish in round
investment is essential for success throughout the game however when assessing the initial cards always ask why would i want this card what do i want to accomplish in round 2 will this help and how well will it work with the other cards i have bought buy all you can but do not buy randomly how fast or slow cards work matters too hot air balloon is a very fast way to beat others to claim a site bonus you really want on the other hand using torch then axe then pickaxe would be an incredibly slow way to turn 2 fear into 2 tablets and an arrow for research taking four turns to advance one research step certainly will not win you any research track bonuses but if there are no good assistants out and you want to stall and see if someone will reveal a better one and then slow is better there are also a few very rare cases where the single available artifact is worth going for
will reveal a better one and then slow is better there are also a few very rare cases where the single available artifact is worth going for in the first round such as passage shell star charts or guiding skull i am sure you can think of others this often means hitting the compass camp first and not exploring but if the artifact gives you value equal to two camps it will usually be worth it and at the very least adds a plane to your deck if you go this route try to eventually get the tablet assistant to make it easier to activate the artifact again whenever it comes back around 14  p a g e assistants compared to cards this one is a little more clearly defined maybe you have a few favorite assistants but the one i am confident saying is always worth competing for is the coin assistant i am not going to justify that here as there are other threads on that
few favorite assistants but the one i am confident saying is always worth competing for is the coin assistant i am not going to justify that here as there are other threads on that topic if you see him or possibly another assistant you very much want consider shaping your first round strategy to get you that assistant asap that usually means exploring and using the idol to gain a research resource instead of using it to deal with the guardian on bird temple 7 of the 10 possible level i sites give a research resource you need making exploration a sound strategy for getting a first round assistant if you expect stiff competition consider the risky step of exploring as your first action instead of a campsite on snake that drops to only 4 of 10 so a slow and steady approach is better  secure tablets or a jewel before exploring if your hand and store only add up to 3 compasses this may also mean needing to explore a site with a
steady approach is better  secure tablets or a jewel before exploring if your hand and store only add up to 3 compasses this may also mean needing to explore a site with a compass bonus for insurance so check your travel options to be sure that is possible before committing yourself a word of caution about a hard drive for assistants part of the reason the coin assistant is the only one worth doing this for is not just that he is strategically superior  its that doing this for anyone else generally means you will miss out on buying good cards or possibly any cards at all in addition no assistant is worth getting a hand of just starting cards in round 2 setting goals it should be clear by now that as you make the above assessments you are also deciding on your objectives for this round often the answer is a mix there are good cards a great assistant and maybe you have an idea for how you want round 2 to go as well however
on your objectives for this round often the answer is a mix there are good cards a great assistant and maybe you have an idea for how you want round 2 to go as well however when pulled in different directions set a priority determine which actions you must not be locked out of whether a campsite or a card and steel yourself to take this action even if it may lose your shot at a secondary goal for instance buying a card straight off might mean losing the coins camp and getting fewer cards overall but if that card is crucial to your round 2 goal that may be okay any time you buy before moving consider what campsite options may be left to you by next turn based on the number of players this is safest when your second action will be exploring and you are fine with any spare campsite however if you plan to take two campsites or if you absolutely need to take compasses first strongly consider moving to the one you want first
are fine with any spare campsite however if you plan to take two campsites or if you absolutely need to take compasses first strongly consider moving to the one you want first no card is worth risking someone completely eating your lunch on the first round likewise if you need to take an action to prepare ie getting more coins or compasses to afford a purchase before you pull that trigger consider how likely it is that someone else wants it too and have a plan b if that card is snapped up of course extra coins or compasses are pretty easy to pivot from and if there are several good items out youd be happy with definitely start by moving to coins at least one good one will likely still be there 15  p a g e next turn and with luck youll get a few more may always be revealed as with cards the same goes for assistants consider your odds and what you will do if you
next turn and with luck youll get a few more may always be revealed as with cards the same goes for assistants consider your odds and what you will do if you lose the contest if there are two good assistants available this is pretty low risk in addition if you are torn between cards and an assistant go for the one you are more certain to accomplish since it is unlikely your opponents will let you get both considering turn order did i say there were three main things to assess before moving well okay four turn order can also matter quite a bit too how achievable your possible goals may be it also creates an inherent dynamic that should incline you towards a certain goal which i will summarize at the top of each section  this should help you decide when torn between different objectives i will be using the bird temple board as the default point of reference in this section but will note one or two considerations where they differ on snake
objectives i will be using the bird temple board as the default point of reference in this section but will note one or two considerations where they differ on snake player 1 starting resources 2 coins summary buy cards first glance this player gets first crack at buying any great cards initially dealt but absolutely must take the compass site if they want to explore if there are not any mustbuy cards they also get first crack at any campsite  a research resource or coins to stock up on tools for a great round 2 in more depth unless there is a topnotch card out player 1 is often at less of an advantage than it seems generally id advise against exploring and instead work to position yourself well going forward your choice between a research resource or coins as your first move depends very much on whether you are motivated more by the cards or the assistants you see taking the research resource is more defensive guaranteeing that
your first move depends very much on whether you are motivated more by the cards or the assistants you see taking the research resource is more defensive guaranteeing that nobody will get both of them and an easy assistant but it is likely they can get around this by exploring generally therefore i lean to coins first if you can also get a research resource you will have 67 coins to spend this turn which should strengthen your deck immensely for the duration of the game snake variation on snake if you have 2 compass in hand there is another exception to taking coins first the ideal strategy is to hit the tablet camp then the arrow camp which is very unlikely to be taken yet even in a 4player game this will let you move your glass 2 steps up earning you 2 coins and probably a bonus tile  equivalent to a free visit to the coin site and likely putting you ahead in the race to rescue a second assistant if you have
steps up earning you 2 coins and probably a bonus tile  equivalent to a free visit to the coin site and likely putting you ahead in the race to rescue a second assistant if you have only 1 compass though stick to the coinsfirst plan multiplayer variants in a 2player game there is less drafting off sites explored by other players until late in the game so it can be tempting to explore in the first round however id advise instead taking 16  p a g e a page out of the player 3 advice to store compasses and buy tools that will let you explore a level ii site in the 2nd round this will net you more resources total by the end of round 3 if you see an assistant who will really help with this coins or a travel assistant it can be an exception to my coinsfirst advice 1 out of 3 times your opponent will need to hit compasses to explore if you hit research first and they go compass you get to take the
exception to my coinsfirst advice 1 out of 3 times your opponent will need to hit compasses to explore if you hit research first and they go compass you get to take the other research resource and have first pick of assistants in a 3 or 4player game there is no greaterthanaverage urgency to get to the level ii sites you will be going last next round so your chance of a free dig site is slim this is why i advise taking coins first and picking off 2 ideally 3 tools to use next round because in that round you will likely need to explore for yourself and you may not get any research track bonuses but if youre wellequipped its entirely possible to get both your assistants by the end and be caught up to the pack on research player 2 starting resources 1 coin 1 compass summary explore first glance the second player is probably the one most invested in exploring in the first round giving them a guaranteed explored site to revisit in round 2
summary explore first glance the second player is probably the one most invested in exploring in the first round giving them a guaranteed explored site to revisit in round 2 in more depth if we assume that player 2 will use their second action to explore the question becomes chiefly how best to use their first action this depends in part on their opening hand  a onecompass hand makes it critical for them to visit the compass site first case closed however if player 1  who must always go compass if they decide to explore  beats them to it this puts player 2 in a bind so they must quickly pivot their plan for this round they will still get first crack at explored sites in round 2 but without an idol gaining an assistant this round is unlikely except in a 2player game in this scenario they are therefore thrust into a position more like being player 1 and should refer to the advice there
this round is unlikely except in a 2player game in this scenario they are therefore thrust into a position more like being player 1 and should refer to the advice there  with two compass cards in hand they have the luxury of visiting one of the initial research resource campsites first guaranteeing their first assistant this round  and under the occasional ideal circumstances being able to actually gain both assistants in the first round for more on this niche maneuver see the recent comprehensive strategy article by timthe3nchanter in the second scenario you have more flexibility and the question becomes which research resource to choose this depends on your goals for the round if you want to get an assistant ideally coins to buy more cards then take the jewel camp you are more likely to gain an arrow than a gem from exploring and either way you would rather use your
an assistant ideally coins to buy more cards then take the jewel camp you are more likely to gain an arrow than a gem from exploring and either way you would rather use your idol for arrowtablets than spend a coin for a gem this round when you very much want to buy an item or two though if going for the coin assistant and you have a onefear hand do not hesitate to discard a coin for jewel  just be mindful of which coin to keep for optimal travel purposes 17  p a g e if no great assistant is out take the arrow camp first most guardians require an arrow since you are in no rush it makes more sense to deal with the guardian this round since you are presumably coming back here in round 2 and this will save you a fear and future effort also use that overcome action strategically if a good card you can afford is out seize it first if there is not stall by dealing with the guardian and probably someone will buy a card or two in the meantime
seize it first if there is not stall by dealing with the guardian and probably someone will buy a card or two in the meantime snake variation taking the tablets camp before exploring on snake is advisable particularly if you can score a bonus compass when you explore the chance of getting an arrow or a jewel is then 710 allowing you to use the idol slot to get the other taking an assistant and moving your glass a second step for those valuable coins multiplayer variants in a 2player game the main thing to be wary of is a potential assistant race though this mostly only matters if the coin assistant is available if player 1 takes compasses they are likely going to explore this potentially gives them the edge take a research resource first as per usual and see what their second move is and if they get what they need from exploration then choose between exploring coins or the other research resource based
as per usual and see what their second move is and if they get what they need from exploration then choose between exploring coins or the other research resource based on whether a the site they found is one you will be happy enough taking next round and b you prefer an assistant this round or more cards in 3 or 4 player games there is generally less to worry about in the first round since players tend to hit the camps first you will likely explore before others do getting your pick of site bonuses and first crack at assistants if multiple players explore the entire better for you as you will also have first pick of sites and remaining guardians next round player 3 starting resources 2 coins 1 compass summary hoard compasses first glance while apparently similar to player 2 just with an extra coin there is a crucial difference they will not go first next round this might suggest they should explore as well
first glance while apparently similar to player 2 just with an extra coin there is a crucial difference they will not go first next round this might suggest they should explore as well so there are at least two discovered level i dig sites next round and thus they will be guaranteed access to one the problem with that is that it will always be the less useful site that player 2 leaves for you possibly a fairly useless one for round 2 research a better option is to aim instead for a level ii site in round 2 in more depth does that sound ambitious it is but highly effective the sacrifice is not exploring this round and hoarding compasses if you can pull it off though its worth it because you can hit that level ii site again when you go first in round 3 and thus will have more resources overall by that point in the first round this means investing in specific cards you need compasses such as steam boat or rough map and ideally a cheap card
more resources overall by that point in the first round this means investing in specific cards you need compasses such as steam boat or rough map and ideally a cheap card that gives doubletravel symbols like gold pan or sturdy boots i hope that gain a step towards your first assistant as well a travel assistant is ideal since they can help you move both rounds smoothing out the travel symbol challenge 18  p a g e this means prioritizing coins camp if it is still available compasses unless you can buy tools worth 2 or 3 next round and whatever research resource will not require you to spend a compass this round pretty much in that order it also means keeping an eagle eye out for items that you need and snapping them up as they come by in addition sometimes no items come along that will help you and you are blocked from the compass camp so there is virtually no chance of getting the 6 compasses you need in
in addition sometimes no items come along that will help you and you are blocked from the compass camp so there is virtually no chance of getting the 6 compasses you need in that case pivot your plan explore this round try to get an assistant and take whatever free dig site player 2 gives you in round 2 and explore again do not get so stuck on the ideal plan that you do not recognize it will not work until it is too late snake variation honestly not much level ii site rewards are actually easier to make the most of in rounds 2 and 3 ie on the lower half of the research track on snake than they are on bird so this is an ideal tactic whenever possible multiplayer variants this is easier to execute in 3player where it is unlikely that you will be blocked from any camp sites if you are not exploring even if your second move is not to a camp that helps this round if for some reason nobody explores in the first round or buys any cards in their
camp sites if you are not exploring even if your second move is not to a camp that helps this round if for some reason nobody explores in the first round or buys any cards in their first two turns you will be forced to use a 2foot location follow the priority of coinscompassother spending on what is available in 4player this gets tricky you definitely want to buy specific cards and you cannot control when they come out but you also do not want to be stuck taking two 2foot locations so generally you will not want to buy a card before your first move if others are on a buying spree this may give you leeway but be cautious best case everyone else will explore with his or her second move but you cannot be sure if you do not have a camp to move your second archaeologist to that will gain you resources 2 coin cards for a coin camp is a pointless move explore instead as above do not hesitate to pivot if the plan is not working player 4

in more depth i started the article commenting that your opening choices should seem simple but rarely are in addition in the case of being player 4 they are even more 19  p a g e constrained however it does not mean you should not think them through  it means you have to think a little differently unlike other players you will be focused less on setting an objective for yourself at the outset and more about making the most of what opportunities present themselves as the round unfolds naturally you still need to do your initial assessments of cards and assistants  as they are when play reaches you and bearing in mind that as several players could be ahead of you in the assistant race also do this every turn because better cards or assistants may be revealed and you want to keep your options open to seize whatever comes your way next you should look over the unexplored site bonus tiles before making your first move
revealed and you want to keep your options open to seize whatever comes your way next you should look over the unexplored site bonus tiles before making your first move  because which one you aim for may effect which campsite you take  if you have one compass in hand youll want to explore a site with a compass bonus to maximize the chance you can take an assistant if you choose to do so  if you have two compasses look for an upgrade site bonus if theres one you can travel to consider taking the campsite that is apparently useless for research this round because the upgrade will turn it into one you can use tabletsarrow on bird temple arrowjewel on snake if there was a card rush among other players and there are extra campsites open you will need to do a little more assessment here is how i would approach whichever sites are left open to you  if coins is free i think i would always go there first buying cards first round is
need to do a little more assessment here is how i would approach whichever sites are left open to you  if coins is free i think i would always go there first buying cards first round is indispensable  if compass camp is free and you have a onefear hand it may occur that you could actually explore a level ii site this round do not it does give you a guaranteed assistant but you will not have much control over which one and without the coins assistant there is a good chance you will be unable to buy any cards as a result given that you likely will not get to that site again until round 4 your midgame is going to tank  on the other hand if the compass site is open and there is a great opening artifact most likely nobody else is going for it take your shot  if a useful research resource is available this is the best choice after coins then you can aim for a compass site bonus if you do not have a spare or else a coin bonus to buy
if a useful research resource is available this is the best choice after coins then you can aim for a compass site bonus if you do not have a spare or else a coin bonus to buy more or better cards birdsnake variations on bird it is usually tablets and another camp that is open and except in the upgrade scenario mentioned above it is probably the other one that you want whatever it is on snake though arrows will likely be free and if you have a 2compass hand and can visit a bonuscompass site go arrows and use your idol slot for tablets see the section on player 1 about the advantages of advancing your glass two steps on snake okay that is it for me do any of these suggestions strike you as confusing or wrong do you have any favorite opening strategies a particular turn order you prefer to start with fire away 20  p a g e advanced strategy tips just wanted to add some advanced tips here  learn from others
fire away 20  p a g e advanced strategy tips just wanted to add some advanced tips here  learn from others the main way that i got better was to watch full game replays when i lost to see what other players did well and what i missed most of what i learned after the fact was how i did not move fast enough for the things i wanted  travel quickly and wisely you should have a game plan of where you want to travel before the next round even starts that means knowing what travel icons you will likely have so you can make the journey and making sure you get there first if you really need it  gold is king what really made me take a step up from 7080 point scores into the 90s and 100s is doing more deck building to build a good deck you typically need gold or compasses the 2 gold assistant is by far the best one imo and if it is available on round 1 try your best to be
more deck building to build a good deck you typically need gold or compasses the 2 gold assistant is by far the best one imo and if it is available on round 1 try your best to be the first to claim it i never have a bad game if i get the 2 gold assistant on round 1  dont assume you will have time or opponents will be rational i have had many situations where i thought i would be able to travel to a spot because it made no sense for my opponent to go there only for them to go there anyway this happens a lot more with weaker players but you should make sure that if you need something do not take unnecessary risks this also happens in round 5 where i think i can buy an artifact a bit later only for my opponents to buy it before me even though it does not work as well for them  be careful with your item slots unless you have stone key i always leave at least 1 item slot free exploring without an
work as well for them  be careful with your item slots unless you have stone key i always leave at least 1 item slot free exploring without an item slot open puts you in a vulnerable position since you can often struggle to kill the guardian i usually refrain from travel if i have used all my slots and instead buy artifacts with my extra compasses  general timing on bird temple there are general benchmarks for where you should be at each stage by round 2 you should have both assistants by the end of round 4 you should have gotten at least 1 assistant upgraded and your glass right before the draw a card bit otherwise it will take too many resources for you to make it up and get a good score i have had games where i have finished all research by round 4 which is an extremely good place to be  go the long way not the short way part of making more resources in this game is going circuitous routes to get what you need
go the long way not the short way part of making more resources in this game is going circuitous routes to get what you need so if for example you need an arrow to kill a guardian do not just immediately use an item 21  p a g e slot to get it maybe the best way is to buy tablets instead use that to upgrade your assistant which gives you an extra arrow this means that you advanced up a research space as well as got what you needed  kill guardians last unless you need the guardian boon like the card draw one or for travel kill monsters last that is because killing monsters lowers your available resources and does not offer anything immediately in return you want to have as many resources as possible so you have the most options only spend resources if it moves you up the track which gives you stuff or you really need a particular travel spot item or artifact  use everything
have the most options only spend resources if it moves you up the track which gives you stuff or you really need a particular travel spot item or artifact  use everything if you have a hand with 2 fears find a way to make that work for you  campsite for a jewel for instance or the guardians ocarina so you can use your fears to travel  if you have a pickaxe or something that requires a resource make sure you are able to take advantage of it you should aim to never keep cards between rounds it is a big loss if you have a card that you cannot use in your hand it is like you played a round with 4 not 5 cards  understand your deck composition this is where it gets a bit advanced and you need some experience you should aim to make your deck work with your assistants intelligently if for instance you have a pickaxe and trowel make sure your assistants give you compasses if you have coin assistants
make your deck work with your assistants intelligently if for instance you have a pickaxe and trowel make sure your assistants give you compasses if you have coin assistants make sure your items give you compasses if you are taking in loads of fears go the card draw or exile assistant i think the exile assistant is playable never your first pick up but it can be a decent 2nd one if are traveling often to fear sites and it gives an extra compass once upgraded trap items there are a few cards which i consider to be traps and rarely ever pick up precision compass  it is too expensive only gives 1 point at the end and bloats your deck it is also a bad pick up early since you have fewer artifacts to choose from and a bad pick up late because of its high cost and lack of replayability machete  i also never buy this it is one of the most poorly designed cards imo it should be 42 or 31 since the exile a card ability is a soft bonus

revolver  one of the worst items in the game imo the biggest problem is that it does not create resources killing guardians should be secondary to generating raw resources revolver does not generate any i find i use it for travel at the end of games sometimes just as proof of how useless a card it is this should have cost a coin to kill the monster and be 42 i will only buy this as part of some intricate play with the artifact that puts this on top of your deck so you can get a cheap monster kill the turn you buy it by drawing a card airplane  okay hear me out i do not think the card is bad it is just not worth destroying your early game for i see some players use their turn 1 to throw all their gold at buying this first i do not think it is good enough to be worth doing that for you will find that the most annoying thing about it is that it only provides 2 not 3 compasses i think this is best bought
first i do not think it is good enough to be worth doing that for you will find that the most annoying thing about it is that it only provides 2 not 3 compasses i think this is best bought when it is natural to do so either with the help of the 2 gold assistant or the itembuying tier 1 square do not wreck your turn 1 strategy just to buy this you end up basing your whole game around it and cap out at about 80 points trap assistants goldarrow assistant  this is one of the biggest traps and one i see a lot of even veteran players fall in it looks very tempting to pick it up on round 1 because it could help you kill a guardian that turn but it ends up taking up all your gold and causing your deck to be very small and ultimately weak i will only pick this one up if i have the gold assistant or heavy gold items like gold pan or watch it can be bought as a second assistant if your deckassistant allows never as a first
gold items like gold pan or watch it can be bought as a second assistant if your deckassistant allows never as a first shopping assistant  the guy that allows you to buy an artifact or an item it looks flexible on paper in practice it is slow cumbersome and often useless resources are key you want your assistant to give you travel symbols or icons and this does neither underrated items whip  one of the best items in the game imo it gives you effectively 4 compasses for just 2 gold and replaces itself with a new high value artifact in the process i do not mind picking this up on turn 1 while others might overlook it if you do not have a good artifact to buy on turn 2 use it for travel and it will come back around in turn 3 or 4 when there are good artifacts to buy being able to snipe a valuable artifact the moment it shows up like guiding skull or star charts can be game defining and this lets you do it quickly and sneakily too sometimes

1 desplaza las cartas hacia la vara lunar para que quede espacio tablero si un efecto muestra este símbolo significa que podrás desterrar en el extremo una carta de la mano o de tu zona de juego 2 descubre una carta y ponla en el espacio que haya quedado vacío un consejo a ser posible es mejor usar una carta y luego desterrarla de tu zona de juego antes que desterrarla de la mano si un mazo se queda sin cartas dejarás de desplazar y reponer las car tas de ese tipo 12

these points will be added into their final score thus in each round your rival can earn 0 2 4 or 6 points from objectives you do not earn points but you can reduce the amount of points your rival gains tile shortage if you aggressively pursue the objectives the rival expedition will accomplish objectives only when they get lucky and you will have enough 2point tiles to last the entire game however if you are pursuing a less antagonistic strategy you may occasionally need to give your rival a 6point tile so you can return three 2point tiles to the supply tweaks we feel that 3 objectives per round gives the game good variety and increases the challenge of the usual solo game it is possible to get a taste of this expansion by dealing only 2 objectives each round you can also increase the challenge by using 4 objectives but the variety is best with 2 or 3 another way to tweak the expansion is to make the first card turned
you can also increase the challenge by using 4 objectives but the variety is best with 2 or 3 another way to tweak the expansion is to make the first card turned up worth 4 points put two 2point temple tiles on it to denote that it is a higherpriority objective key be the first player to buy an item this round be the first player to discover a new site this round be the first player to have a lot of archaeologists on the main board your rival needs 3 you need 2 tip to help you remember this objective put 3 rival archaeologists on the card  or 2 if your rival has already sent one to the main board be the first player to buy an artifact this round be the first player to advance their magnifying glass token this round this booklet contains two printandplay miniexpansions for the lost ruins of arnak solo game the rival objectives expansion adds

an effect that lets you gain an item for free counts as buying the item which would accomplish the buy an item objective it is possible to accomplish multiple objectives on one turn because the discover a new site objective overlaps with the archaeologists objective even your rival could accomplish two on one turnour joy at discovering the petroglyphs was greatly diminished when we also discovered the other expeditions footprints too many times have we been second well no more if they plan to leave their camp at sunrise then we must leave ours before first light 1arnak solo miniexpansions i tell my comrades to stay on task to ignore the other expedition and focus instead on what we can do how i wish i could take my own advice it seems that no matter how much we accomplish each day the other expedition is always able to do a little more purple actions congratulations on winning the lost ruins of arnak solo variant
we accomplish each day the other expedition is always able to do a little more purple actions congratulations on winning the lost ruins of arnak solo variant multiple times at the highest difficulty level many fans of arnak have written to us telling us how they have already beaten our toughest solo game and are looking for a bigger challenge here it is components the action tiles that came with your game are replaced by these printandplay action cards setup instead of a stack of action tiles you will make a deck of action cards use the 5 archaeologist action cards as usual and add 5 purple or red action cards one of each type your difficulty level increases by 1 for each red card and 2 for each purple card giving you a range from 5 to 10 we have also included printandplay versions of the green tiles in case you want to use them too the other difference in setup is that the rival expedition will now have a notebook token to go with their
case you want to use them too the other difference in setup is that the rival expedition will now have a notebook token to go with their magnifying glass actions purple actions are mostly the same as red and green actions  but nastier research in round v the rival expedition advances their magnifying glass twice thus it is possible for them to get 2 temple tiles in one turn overcome a guardian after overcoming a guardian or researching with the magnifying glass when no guardian is available the rival expedition will research with their notebook  unless that would move their notebook above their magnifying glass their notebook can remove research bonus tiles and it will score notebook points at the end of the game note if you are using the rival objectives miniexpansion the notebook has no effect on the magnifying glass objective buy a card your rival buys two cards with one action one of each type one
notebook has no effect on the magnifying glass objective buy a card your rival buys two cards with one action one of each type one card is the one with the highest point value in the indicated type the other is the card with lowest point value discover a new site the action f ollows the same rules as bef ore  however at the end of the game each of the rival expeditions idols is worth one extra point thats 4 points for each unique faceup idol and 3 points for those in the 1 stack note this rule applies only if this purple card is among those chosen for the game 2
lost ruins of arnak  expedition leaders solitaire campaign challenge who is the greatest expedition leader to fathom the lost ruins of arnak who among these talented individuals can aspire to the coveted title of araanus chosen one it is time to test which archaeologist reigns supreme overview in this solitaire campaign challenge you will be pitting each expedition leader individually against the rival down the challenge of all four research tracks while escalating the difficulty until success is achieved death claims the weak and a final score for dominance is determined for each leader played starting difficulty  the rivals action card deck starts using all 5 red action cards the adventures 1 bird temple 2 snake temple 3 monkey temple  snake board 4 lizard temple  snake board escalating difficulty rules after each successful adventure the expedition leader progresses to the next adventure and increases the difficulty
4 lizard temple  snake board escalating difficulty rules after each successful adventure the expedition leader progresses to the next adventure and increases the difficulty level by one  adding in a random purple action card  and removing the corresponding red action card after each failed or tied adventure the adventure must be repeated at the same difficulty level however a different action card deck is constructed for the rival for any adventure after the first basic level 5 difficulty bird temple adventure refresh any purple cards included under the current difficulty replacing them with a new random selection of purple card action cards this will keep each challenge fresh avoiding expedition leaders repeatedly coming up against rival deck combinations that seem uniquely tuned to giving them a problem note playtesting revealed that you should not include both purple action cards which give the rival both artifacts
note playtesting revealed that you should not include both purple action cards which give the rival both artifacts and items this deadly combination unbalanced campaign difficulty too wildly between expedition leaders dominance  death pioneered by the search for professor kutil campaign  the dominance score is simply the cumulative delta or difference between scores for successive adventures  but there is a catch for each failed adventure a 5pt penalty is applied to the expedition leaders overall dominance after repeating an adventure should the expedition leader ever incur a negative overall dominance they are killed example 1 for the ideal example consider a contender who defeats the bird temple at difficulty 5 then proceeds to the snake temple on difficulty 6 and so on each victory over the rival would sum the differences between their four scores for that expedition leaders final dominance
the snake temple on difficulty 6 and so on each victory over the rival would sum the differences between their four scores for that expedition leaders final dominance example 2 less than ideal but more realistic perhaps sees a contender pass the bird temple at difficulty 5 then fail the snake temple on difficulty 6 say their dominance after the bird temple was 17  which was how much they defeated the rival by for the snake temple they lost by 12 so their overall dominance has now been cut to 5 after swapping in a new random selection of purple action cards for the rival deck they attempt the snake temple again and win by 7 their new dominance score goes up to 12 but they must incur the 5pt penalty for having to repeat the adventure so their overall dominance diminishes to 7 should they fail the next adventure by more than 2 the 5pt penalty would kill them off entirely  so theyd better make it good
repeat the adventure so their overall dominance diminishes to 7 should they fail the next adventure by more than 2 the 5pt penalty would kill them off entirely  so theyd better make it good supremacy after playing however many expedition leaders you choose the coveted title of araanus chosen one goes to the highest overall dominance conclusion i had great fun playtesting this scheme it lends much to the solitaire replay value of the game beyond just playing random expedition leaders against the rival in oneoff scenarios its interesting especially to see which leader plays best to your own particular style and rotating the rival deck kept every adventure fresh and interesting enjoy

collective intel the worlds top researchers have gleaned that the shadow creatures have some connection to the lost ruins of arnak but what is that connection the answer lies nears the site of the lost ruins of arnak the researchers must travel there to ﬁnd the answer using research exploration smarts and a little luck the researchers will work together to discover the shadow creatures motivations and the appropriate response can the researchers ﬁgure out the shadow creatures motivations before time runs out and the earth is destroyed can you help them to win the game players must together discover and satisfy the shadow creature motivations to save the earth 13 setup 131 character setup at the beginning of the game each player randomly or deliberately gets a character card each character has a special ability heshe can use once per round character cards are like assistants exhaust and refresh character cards

142 research motivations if players wait until the start of the 4th or 5th round to see the shadow creature motivation cards they may be unlikely able to satisify the conditions on those cards there is a mechanism to ﬂip the motivations faceup early but it is not easy you may add research tokens either a gold or compass to motivation cards to ﬂip them up early you can research motivations if you add 1 research token per player to motivation card 1 on space 4 you may ﬂip it as soon as you placed the last token if you add 2 research tokens per player to motivation card 2 on space 5 you may ﬂip it as soon as you placed the last token we must discover the motivations early 4 chapter 1 lost ruins of arnak cooperative modelost ruins of arnak cooperative mode release 10 how do players research motivations on your turn you may play a research token when you do any of the following on your turn

of the shamans it is a good thing that we beat the mystic to it otherwise we were doomed for sure now that we have him in custody and the guardians are back to being friendly we can take our time to research even more and hopefully discover more secrets and the way of life of these strange tribes who dwelled here so long ago we also found out why we discovered so many human bones connections between the tribes people and the guardians had its down sides when making the bond a human sacrifice needed to be made those who sacrificed themselves were buried with honours that we lost so many assistants had to do with the aggressive nature of the guardians after the failed bonding attempt of antoinette we will honour those who gave their lives for this discovery rewards you have beaten the mystic and you have saved the museum your reward is that you will go down into history as one of the most important archeologists in the world you should be proud of yourself congratulations
