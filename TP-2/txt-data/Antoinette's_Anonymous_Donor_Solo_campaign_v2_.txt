Campaign: Antoinette’s Anonymous Donor (solo campaign played after the Search for Professor Kutil. After finding and rescuing Professor Kutil, we did not dare stay on the island. The guardians were just too aggressive after Antoinette’s ritual. So we called it quits and went home with the High Priest’s Crown and the Earrings carefully wrapped and tucked away for safe keeping. The museum would be delighted with these artifacts and our stories that go with it. 3 years later When again a wealthy unknown sponsor approached our small team offering to fund another expedition to Arnak, I was not surprised at all! Its sole goal would be to locate more artifacts like the crown and the earrings and bring them home. These historical items were a treasure beyond imagination.  The trip and the dig was hard enough on itself last time and I was still worried about those guardians that were still there on the island. Would they be calmer by now, three years later? Needless to say, we accepted of course. This time though Antoinette and her fanatics were not invited, some of her crew we had to leave behind. We did not want to face another splintered party. We brought in a new member. A guy who’s experience was in the field of the unexplained and mythology. Maybe he could find out what Antoinette was doing and see why those beasts were behaving the way they were. Although we were a bit scared to face those monsters again we did learn from our first visit and therefore we came more prepared. Campaign Rules Introduction To play the campaign, you need the LOST RUINS OF ARNAK board game and EXPEDITION LEADERS expansion, and you need to be familiar with the rules for the solo variant. Since this campaign is played after the Search for Professor Kutil, We assume that you already are familiar with the solo rules.
After following the special setup instruction for each chapter, set up the rest of the game following the standard solo game setup. Each chapter will specify, which side of the boards to use, as well as certain tweaks that will make the chapter unique. Be sure to check out the special setup rules before setting up the game. 
You may play the campaign with the purple actions (not play tested though) from the solo mini-expansion that you can ﬁnd at the arnak.game web app.
You also may play with the blue or the red staﬀ.
New keywords  There are several new elements we are introducing in the campaign. These are: 
Your Rival will be The Mystic from Expedition Leaders and therefore cannot be played. Special explanations will follow in the special rules of the chapter.
Special Rules  These will be revealed for each chapter as you progress through the story.  Goals  When you accomplish the goals, you win the chapter. Even then, keep playing until the end of round IV to record your ﬁnal score.  Achievements  It is not necessary to complete them to win the game, but completing them can improve your score and possibly oﬀer extra rewards to carry on to the next chapters.  Story Markers  You will need a handful of coins or board game tokens to mark certain story points. The reserve tiles may be used for this purpose. The starting player marker will be used as a special story marker. The rival does not gain nor remove any story markers unless mentioned in the chapter special rules. Story Cards are included in a separate ﬁle. There is a deck of story cards included in a separate ﬁle. You may print them out or just use the ﬁle to look up the story card. Unless the setup specify otherwise, use dice (2x 1d6, rolls can be between 2-12) to determine which story card you reveal. Resolve the story card immediately.  Reward  At the end of a chapter you will receive a reward. This will be something to bring to the next chapter like a speciﬁc artifact.
Scoring and Winning  The diﬃculty should be set for the entire campaign before you start the ﬁrst game. That way, it will be easier for you to compare your score with your future results or with other players.  You win a chapter if you complete all the goals. Compare your score with the rival!s score the diﬀerence between them is your dominance.
Dominance. You do not need to beat the rival!s score to win, you can continue the campaign with a negative dominance. 
You lose the chapter if the game ends before you accomplish the chapter!s goals. Record no score and try the chapter again. 
Campaign results are counted after you win the ﬁnal chapter. Your score for the campaign on the chosen diﬃculty is the sum of all the chapters!"dominances. 
Symbols and explanations   = level 1 dig site,  = level 2 dig site Meet your Rival.  The Mystic will be your rival so use its player board, but not the cards. You will need to choose the rival deck diﬃculty through the web app (or solo components) to use during the whole campaign. Keep the same diﬃculty throughout the entire campaign. The app will provide you with your starting resources otherwise take a look in the table of the the Search for Professor Kutil campaign rules. You will see your diﬃculty level name, as well as your starting resources, which might diﬀer from the normal solo game. 
NOTE: If you use the app make sure you play with the solo app and not the campaign app. Also do not choose any objectives when you play for the ﬁrst time. Of course if you want no problem.  
Chapter I, The Shore Line When we arrived, the island seemed less pristine than last time we were here. Maybe this had to do with the fact that we have been here before and that the Guardians were on a rampage just before we left. The wreckage of the plane near the shore is gone. Instead we found a whole bunch of skeletons nearby. One was a giant skull of one of the Guardians and the other one was of a human. Presumably one of the assistants from Antoinette’s crew that we had to leave behind. The others were further away but looked like Guardian remains as well. What has happened here?  We setup camp near the shore and went to work. We started with investigating the remains but that seemed already a big risk. All the remains were guarded. Last time we encountered those Beasts they responded in different ways. Some became friendlier when offered gifts; others responded if you best them in a fight. We don’t have the crown or the earrings to calm them down now. Let’s hope they have not changed their ways in those three years. Thank goodness we brought the Mystic with us. Maybe he can come up with some answers for us about these dangerous and mystical creatures. Setup

We cleared the shores and collected an interesting artifact. There is nothing left along the shore line. Nothing to dig up or study. The guardians were not too aggressive although they keep scaring us. We cleared paths and our camping ground is secure. We are ready to go deeper in. Rewards You may keep the item you choose at the start of this chapter and your basic card you did not use stays out of the game.
You also may keep one face down idol and you may add the Pathﬁnder’s Hat artifact in your deck for Chapter II. 
When you have chosen the Hat card though you need to switch it with either the Sturdy Boots or the Pickaxe card for chapter II.
Campaign: Antoinette’s Anonymous Donor (solo campaign played after the Search for professor Kutil. Chapter II, Deeper In After clearing the shore line and discovering human bones on various sites, that we did not find last time we were here, we were starting to get nervous. The Beasts were sometimes very aggressive. That Giant Owl from last time seemed to behave different as well. It did not seem to be interested in any items like last time. We need to get to the other sites deeper in the jungle. Blaze a trail so it is easy to follow, so we cannot get lost. Also keep an eye on that Mystic. He does not seem to bothered by these great Monsters. Strangely enough, I think he might enjoy their company. I know, I know that is what he does, but still it freaks me out. Make sure you write everything down you experience, find or think. We need all of it. Keep your research safe and with you at all times. Stay on the path and stay focused and alert. Setup  To set up this chapter, follow the steps below and then set up the rest of the game following the standard solo game setup. Use the Snake Temple side.
The Guardian!s Crown, Crystal Earring, and Obsidian Earring artifacts stay out of the game.
Step 1 
From chapter I you may keep the item you choose at the start of that chapter and your basic card you did not use stays out of the game. When you have chosen the Hat card though you need to switch it with either the Sturdy Boots or the Pickaxe card for the following chapters. You also may keep one face down idol and you may add the Pathﬁnder’s Hat artifact in your deck for this chapter. You also start with an extra fear card.
So your starter’s deck has the following cards:
3 basic cards, 3 fear cards, 1 artifact and 1 item card.
Step 2
Place 3 assistants on the research track. Place 2 scroll tokens on top of the assistants as a reminder that you collect the scroll and not the assistant.
Step 3 Only place the 2 point tiles on the Lost Temple. No other point tiles can be claimed in the normal way. Each stack should contain 3 2-point tiles. Only you rival can claim 6-point tiles. This is mentioned in the Rival description.

Special Rules  Discovering New Sites  You can only discover the four top lvl 1 dig sites and all lvl 2 dig sites. You are allowed to use sites that has been discovered by your rival.
Researching  When you research with your magnifying glass and you reach the assistant track you get a fear card. Claim the top assistant card and get a scroll token immediately and then discard the assistant. This assistant you claim here is dead and that is the reason why you get a fear card. 
When you reach the assistant track with your book discard a fear card if you can and claim another scroll token.
When you reach level 5 of the research track you gain another scroll instead of the golden side of the assistant. The assistant is dead remember therefore you cannot upgrade it.
In this scenario you can NOT get 2 assistants.

Look up the card in the story cards ﬁle with the same number as the dice and read and apply its eﬀect. Mark down the number you rolled and re-roll the dice if you already rolled that number.

After many rough days we found what we could find. No temples though to study. We did collect another interesting artifact though. Our trails are easy to follow and we never got lost. We mapped out this whole new area. It seems to go smoothly so far. The Mystic has no information for us yet, but he told me he has some good clues he can follow. It sounds promising. The Guardians though are very unpredictable. Their behaviour is very erratic. We need to stay very sharp and take our time. We have no choice but to face the tunnels again. We need to get to the other side of the mountains. Although I said never to return to those dreaded underground tunnels, we must face them yet again. Rewards You may keep the item (Pickaxe or Sturdy Boots) and the artifact (Pathﬁnder’s Hat) for the next chapter. The basic card you did not use this chapter stays out of the game.
The one assistant you got you may also keep for chapter III.
You may also add the artifact; Pathﬁnder’s Sandals in your deck.
Campaign: Antoinette’s Anonymous Donor (solo campaign played after the Search for Professor Kutil. Chapter III, Our Way Through We are doing great if we talk about our research and artifact findings. What bothers me is that we find a lot of human remains. Where is this going. The Mystic has no answers yet besides that he is pretty sure that the tribes who lived here were working together with those Guardians in some way. How may research parties did come here before us. It is clear that others have been here before, even before Professor Kutil’s expedition. Something is not right. How do we keep on losing people without us knowing about it until we find them. We need to stick together and we need to move in bigger groups to protect each other. Make our trails even more clear and visible so it is easy to follow. Getting lost is really not an option. It is too dangerous. Now our next focus is the tunnels that the previous expedition talked about. We need to go there although I swore never to return to that hell hole. We need to reach the other side of those mountains there. That is where we will find all the answers I hope. So far we only explored the things that the previous expedition found and logged. So get your gear. We are going to move base camp and then we going to face the tunnels. Setup  To set up this chapter, follow the steps below and then set up the rest of the game following the standard solo game setup. Use the Snake Temple side and put the Monkey Temple overlay on it.
The Guardian!s Crown, Crystal Earring, and Obsidian Earring artifacts stay out of the game.
Step 1 
From chapter III you may keep the item you choose at the start of that chapter and your basic card you did not use stays out of the game. You may add the Pathﬁnder’s Hat and the Pathﬁnder’s Sandels artifacts in your deck for this chapter. You start with 3 fear cards. You also may keep the one assistant that you got from chapter III.
So your starter’s deck has the following cards:
3 basic cards, 3 fear cards, 2 artifacts and 1 item card.
Step 2
Place the  Pathﬁnder’s Staﬀ artifact on the research track. You must be there before your rival, see goals.
Step 3 
Step 4 Find the following level 1 dig site and place this on one of the three bottom level 1 dig sites. This is up to you which one. This tile is for this chapter considered a camp site from the start and during the game.
Step 5 Place a story token on the artifact on the research track as well as the three left over level 2 dig sites and the level 2 dig site of the tunnel. Place the starter’s token on level 6 of the magnifying glass research track.
Step 6  Take all 5 blocking tiles and block all the 2-boot campsites. In total you will have now 6 camp sites open. Five one-boot and one level 1 dig site, see step 4.
Step 7 Place one face down guardian on the level 2 dig site of the tunnel.
Step 8 Only place the 2 and 6 point tiles in the Lost Temple. No other point tiles can be claimed in the normal way. Each stack should contain 3 tiles maximum. Your rival can claim 6-point tiles. This is mentioned in the Rival description.
Step 9 You start this chapter with the normal 5 cards in your hand.
Special Rules  Discovering New Sites  Before you are allowed to discover any dig site you must visit the tunnel ﬁrst. There are no guardians except on the level 2 dig site of the tunnel. 
Use a random token to indicate you have visited the tunnel. You need to start at the bottom ﬁrst of course. (It is a tunnel after all). Once you have defeated the guardian of the tunnel (the level 2 dig site) you may discover new sites.
The tunnel dig sites are considered discovered so no compass tokens need to be paid, but the travel costs still apply like normal.
Researching  Research is normal except when you reach the artifact with your magnifying glass you may use the artifact right away and put it in your discard deck.
In this scenario you can have 3 assistants.
Story When you reach a story cube on the research track with your magnifying glass or when you visit a lvl 2 dig site take the story token and roll 2d6. Look up the card in the story cards ﬁle with the same number as the dice and read and apply its eﬀect. Mark down the number you rolled and re-roll the dice if you already rolled that number.
When you reach the starter’s token on the research track read story card 1 of chapter III.

 The tunnels were not so bad and there were way less Guardians than we thought, which was a good thing. It was still very scary though. The good thing is now that we are on the other side of the mountains we found so much interesting sites and one other great artifact. We have now more questions than answers, but we are almost there I can feel it. The main temple is hidden somewhere. The temple of the dragon, which I believe is the most important temple on the island. Rewards You may keep the item (Pickaxe or Sturdy Boots) and the artifacts (Pathﬁnder’s Hat, and Sandals) for the next chapter. The basic card you did not use this chapter stays out of the game.
The one assistant you got from Chapter III you may also keep for chapter IV.
You may also add the artifact; Pathﬁnder’s Staﬀ in your deck.
Campaign: Antoinette’s Anonymous Donor (solo campaign played after the Search for professor Kutil. Chapter IV, The Anonymous Donor At last we think we located the main temple. It is hidden within this valley somewhere and must be totally overgrown by now.    Apparently it really does resemble some kind of dragon or lizard. What a find. maybe now we get the answers we are looking for if we can locate it. What did you say. The Mystic moved his base camp just outside of the tunnels. I was not even aware his team went through the tunnels. Well I am sure he wants to be close to the action, like us.  Get your gear and do not forget your water bottles. We are going to find that temple and we keep on going until we have all the answers. Let this be our legacy.

 Congratulations you have found the reason why the Guardians are here. You know now that the Mystic was the Anonymous donor. You have beaten them all and on top of that you discovered so many artifacts that the museum will survive the dwindling visitors due to lack of new exhibits. Well that has been taken care of for sure. The Guardians are bonded with the shaman’s of the tribes protecting this island from invaders. This was the ritual that Antoinette was trying to do but she missed some details. The Mystic wanted to claim everything for himself and hired Antoinette to do some research. He gave her on purpose the wrong ritual information so she would fail. Giving her the power over the Guardians was never his intention. The island , the Guardians and all its treasures. He who controls the Guardians controls the island. The Dragon temple revealed all. The right ritual, the secrets 
of the shamans. It is a good thing that we beat the Mystic to it otherwise we were doomed for sure. Now that we have him in custody and the Guardians are back to being friendly we can take our time to research even more and hopefully discover more secrets and the way of life of these strange tribes who dwelled here so long ago. We also found out why we discovered so many human bones. Connections between the tribes people and the Guardians had its down sides. When making the bond a human sacrifice needed to be made. Those who sacrificed themselves were buried with honours. That we lost so many assistants had to do with the aggressive nature of the Guardians after the failed bonding attempt of Antoinette. We will honour those who gave their lives for this discovery. Rewards You have beaten the Mystic and you have saved the museum. Your reward is that you will go down into history as one of the most important archeologists in the world. You should be proud of yourself. Congratulations.
